The Song of Cricket -

Beneath the sun on fields so wide,
Where bat and ball in dance collide,
The echo of a crowd’s delight,
Marks cricket’s charm from morning light.

With willow poised, the striker stands,
While bowlers craft with cunning hands,
A seam, a spin, a pace so fierce,
Each ball a tale, each shot a pierce.

The slip waits still, the keeper keen,
The outfield hums with silent sheen,
A single run, a boundary blast,
A century carved, a spell well cast.

From dusty lanes to stadium's roar,
In every heart, the game is lore.
A test of will, of mind and might,
Played through the day, into the night.

It teaches calm, it tests the nerve,
Rewards the bold, the ones who serve.
In every over, dreams ignite—
Cricket, a war of grace and fight.
